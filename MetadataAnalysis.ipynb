       "      <th>Resumen La faringoamigdalitis aguda (FAA) en el adulto es una de las enfermedades infecciosas más comunes en la consulta del médico de familia. La etiología más frecuente es viral. Dentro de la etiología bacteriana, el principal agente responsable es Streptococcus pyogenes o estreptococo β-hemolítico del grupo A (EBHGA), causante del 5-30% de los casos. En el manejo diagnóstico, las escalas de valoración clínica para predecir la posible etiología bacteriana, son una buena ayuda para seleccionar a qué pacientes se deben practicar las técnicas de detección rápida de antígeno estreptocócico. Es conocido que, en general, sin estas técnicas se tiende al sobrediagnóstico de FAA estreptocócica, con la consiguiente prescripción innecesaria de antibióticos, muchas veces de amplio espectro. Así, con el manejo de las escalas y la técnica de diagnóstico rápido, elaboramos los algoritmos de manejo de la FAA. Los objetivos del tratamiento son acelerar la resolución de los síntomas, reducir el tiempo de contagio y prevenir las complicaciones supurativas locales y no supurativas. Los antibióticos de elección para el tratamiento de la FAA estreptocócica son penicilina y amoxicilina. La asociación de amoxicilina y clavulánico no está indicada en el tratamiento inicial en la infección aguda. Los macrólidos tampoco son un tratamiento de primera elección; su uso debe reservarse para pacientes con alergia a la penicilina. Es importante en nuestro país adecuar tanto el diagnóstico de la FAA bacteriana y la prescripción de antibióticos a la evidencia científica disponible. La implantación de protocolos de actuación en las farmacias comunitarias puede ser de utilidad para identificar y cribar los casos que no requieran tratamiento antibiótico. Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults is one of the most common infectious diseases seen in general practitioners’ consultations. Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A β-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin. The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper use of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available are crucial. Using management algorithms can be helpful in identifying and screening the cases that do not require antibiotic therapy.</th>\n",

It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds during the pandemic, non-invasive ventilation may have a role in reducing the estimated load.</th>\n",

We show that IFITM expression reduces HIV-1 viral protein synthesis by preferentially excluding viral mRNA transcripts from translation and thereby restricts viral production. Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of virus production. Our studies identify a novel role for IFITMs in inhibiting HIV replication at the level of translation, but show that the effects can be overcome by the lentiviral protein Nef.</th>\n",

Cet intérêt a été amplifié par la pandémie grippale H1N1 mais est également suscité par des améliorations technologiques significatives qui autorisent aujourd’hui la mise en œuvre chez des patients éveillés et mobiles. Mais c’est essentiellement l’émergence d’études randomisées comme dans le syndrome de détresse respiratoire de l’adulte avec des résultats encourageants qui valorisent cette thérapeutique. Connaître la terminologie et les principes généraux de cette technique ainsi que les situations et perspectives futures auxquelles le pneumologue et le réanimateur peuvent être confrontés fait l’objet de cette revue générale. Deux points seront en particulier évoqués tels que les perspectives d’épuration extracorporelle du CO2 dans le cadre des décompensations respiratoires hypercapniques et les situations de suppléances au cours de la transplantation pulmonaire depuis la période préopératoire, jusqu’à la phase postopératoire. Summary Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) effectively replaces the lung in providing oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal. For some years, and in parallel to the H1N1 influenza pandemic, this technique has gained interest in relation to significant technological improvements, leading to new concepts of “awake and mobile ECMO” or rehabilitation with ECMO. Finally, the publication of randomized controlled trials giving encouraging results in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has helped to validate this technique and further studies are warranted. This general review aims to outline the definition, classification and principles of ECMO and to give some current information about the indications and possibilities of the technique to the pulmonologist and intensivist. Further possible uses for this technique include extra-corporeal removal of CO2 during hypercapnic respiratory failure and assistance during lung transplantation from the preoperative to the early postoperative period.</th>\n",

METHODS: 514 white &amp; 285 African-American (AA) patients with knee OA were surveyed. Logistic regression models were performed to determine if the relationship between willingness to undergo TKR and the interaction of patient race and sex were mediated by social support. RESULTS: Compared to whites with knee OA, AA patients were less likely to be married (p&lt;0.001), reported less close friends/relatives (p&lt;0.001) and had lower Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Scale (MOS-SSS) scores (p&lt;0.001). AA patients were also less willing to undergo TKR (62% vs. 80%, p&lt;0.001) than whites. The odds of willingness to undergo TKR was less in white females compared to white males when adjusted for recruitment site, age, income and WOMAC (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34–0.96). This difference was no longer significant when further adjusted for marital status, number of close friends/relatives and MOS-SSS score, but the effect size remained unchanged (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35–1.02). The odds of willingness to undergo TKR remained much less in AA females (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19–0.64) and AA males (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14–0.54) compared to white males when controlled for sociodemographic, clinical and social support measures. CONCLUSIONS: AA patients reported less structural and functional social support than whites. Social support is an important determinant of preference for TKR surgery only among whites.</th>\n",

Since January 23rd, 2020, the strategies of containment and contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation has been implemented extensively in mainland China, and the rates of detection and confirmation have been continuously increased, which have effectively suppressed the rapid spread of the epidemic. In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is of great practical significance to analyze the transmission risk of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of prevention and control strategies by using mathematical models and combining with a small amount of real-time updated multi-source data. On the basis of our previous research, we systematically introduce how to establish the transmission dynamic models in line with current Chinese prevention and control strategies step by step, according to the different epidemic stages and the improvement of the data. By summarized our modelling and assessing ideas, the model formulations vary from autonomous to non-autonomous dynamic systems, the risk assessment index changes from the basic regeneration number to the effective regeneration number, and the epidemic development and assessment evolve from the early SEIHR transmission model-based dynamics to the recent dynamics which are mainly associated with the variation of the isolated and suspected population sizes.</th>\n",

Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.</th>\n",

It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD. Fortunately, this scenario has recently changed with the arrival of new approaches. Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it. Key principles are illustrated through case studies including specifically successful achievements in the field of anticancer drug design to demonstrate that research advances, with the aid of in silico drug design, have the potential to create novel anticancer drugs.</th>\n",
