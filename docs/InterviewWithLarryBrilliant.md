I hold out hope that we get an antiviral for Covid-19 that is curative, but in addition is prophylactic.
 It's certainly unproven and it's certainly controversial, and certainly a lot of people are not going to agree with me. 
 But I offer as evidence two papers in 2005, one in Nature and one in Science. 
 They both did mathematical modeling with influenza, to see whether saturation with just Tamiflu of an area around 
 a case of influenza could stop the outbreak. And in both cases, it worked. I also offer as evidence the fact that
 at one point we thought HIV/AIDS was incurable and a death sentence. 
 Then, some wonderful scientists discovered antiviral drugs, and we've learned that some of those drugs can
 be given prior to exposure and prevent the disease. 
 Because of the intense interest in getting [Covid-19] conquered, we will put the scientific clout and money and 
 resources behind finding antivirals that have prophylactic or preventive characteristics that can be used in addition
  to [vaccines].
